I got my wisdom teeth pulled out; i finished this <a href= "https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/XU12VYUGJ99I">
course </a> on the artistic merit of videogames by the University of Vanderbilt. I also started a new course on Legaltech. Finally, I am close to finishing a course on Data Visualization. Go check it out in the projects section.
